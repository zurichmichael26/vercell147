                I feel sort of sad. Outside, a few cars hissing past, fog hanging like old coats between the trees. The poem is an account of a first date between a young boy and girl.

    <h3>In poems, novels, short stories, plays and over two dozen books for young people however, soto is perhaps best known and most beloved as a writer for children and young adults.</h3>
    <p>It seemed that the sotos were inherently violent. Gary soto is known for a body of work that deals with the realities of growing up in mexican american communities. I feel sort of sad. I remember, for instance, watching my aunts going at one another in my grandmother&#039;s back yard, while the men looked on with beers in their hands and mumbled to one another, perhaps noting the beauty of a jab or a roundhouse punch.</p>
