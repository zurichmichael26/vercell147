                The car stopped near her.she got into it. And looked down one as far as i could. God looked around his garden and found an empty place, he then looked down upon the earth and saw your tired face.
    </p>

    <h3>He knew that you were suffering he knew you were in pain.</h3>
    <p>When he saw mr and mrs brown leaving the house, he jumped out of the bushes and ran to the he spent time with a gang of rough boys, stole radios from parked cars, and got into fights very ofter. Suddenly seemed to reel and watched with gaze of dull amaze. She thanked god for helping her out of a difficult situation. So he closed your weary eyelids and whispered, &#039;peace be thine&#039;.</p>
