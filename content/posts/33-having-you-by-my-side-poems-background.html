    <h3>With you by my side, i would not have survived or fears and doubts.</h3>
    <p>Blues walkin&#039; by my side. A short poem may be a stylistic choice or it may be that you have said what you intended to say in a more concise way. Male poets are often shown composing sonnets for their leading ladies, but many women throughout history have written masterpieces in the name of love. The poem is great because l have brown and l hated them but know l understand that it feel great to have brown eyes but still l still want blue eyes</p>
