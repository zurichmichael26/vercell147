                Sammy&#039;sart i would like to dedicate this bio to my best friend and friends among friends around the world. And experience how he will hold my hand, just like the way he held her&#039;s when they watched a band. The song from the ost was just a song written by fiction plane for the movie.

    <h3>No, really, a found poem;</h3>
    <p>There are mood poems to express mood and tone poems inspired by music &amp; visual art. Fly high my little angel. Read story if only (poem) by forbidden30 with 7,148 reads. However, i also find, that if one reads thirty or so shakespearean sonnets in a row (out loud), something is bound to happen. oh, a lot more than that, oh, a lot more.</p>
