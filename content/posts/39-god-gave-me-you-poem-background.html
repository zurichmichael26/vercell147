                Last christmas i gave you my heart but the very next day you gave it away this year to save me from tears i&#039;ll give it to someone special (happy christmas) i wrapped it up and sent it with a note saying i love you i meant it now i know what a fool i&#039;ve been but if you kissed me now i know. 1لقد كنت قلباً متألّماً يمشي على قدمين لقد جعلتُ من حياتي فوضى وهذا الشخص الذي صرتُه مؤخراً ليس هو من أردتُ أن أكونَه. My angel of mercy to watch over and other poems by this author.
